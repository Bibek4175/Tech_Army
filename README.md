# Project Title: "CommunityConnect: Empowering Citizen Engagement and Collaboration"

# Description:
    Community connect is a web application designed to encourage active citizen engangement and 
    collaboration among the citizens within communities. It simply keeps the records of the registered citizens 
    and also allows the user to have Q/A sessions within the webapp. It enables the citizens to put their opinions, 
    contribute ideas, and participate in decision-making processes. The site being controlled by the governemnt side
    can also interact with the citizens through this website. Thus, it enhances the two way communication and interaction
    between citizens and government.
    
    The primary goal of CommunityConnect is to close the gap between local governments, community leaders, 
    and citizens by providing a user-friendly, informative and interactive user space.
